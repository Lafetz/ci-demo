# CI demo

CI pipeline using GitHub Actions and Docker. The workflow includes stages for code linting, vulnerability checks, testing, coverage analysis, and Docker image building.

To ensure the Docker image can be built and pushed successfully, make sure to include your Docker repository credentials in the GitHub secrets. Set up DH_USERNAME and DH_SECRET in your repository settings to enable authentication with Docker Hub.
